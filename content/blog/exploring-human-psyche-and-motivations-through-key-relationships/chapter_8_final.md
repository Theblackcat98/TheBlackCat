# Chapter 8: Behind the Scenes Conflicts (Final Version)

## Internal Conflicts and Their Impact on Decision Making

Deep within the human psyche, powerful forces often pull in opposing directions, creating internal conflicts that profoundly influence our decisions and behaviors. These psychological struggles—between competing values, desires, identities, and fears—shape our choices in ways that may remain partially or completely outside our conscious awareness. These behind-the-scenes conflicts represent some of the most powerful drivers of human behavior, often creating pivotal turning points when they finally surface into awareness.

Understanding these internal conflicts provides crucial insight into why people sometimes act against their stated intentions, make seemingly irrational choices, or feel paralyzed when facing important decisions. By recognizing these inner battles, we gain perspective on both our own puzzling behaviors and the sometimes contradictory actions of others.

**The Nature of Internal Conflict**

Internal conflicts arise when different aspects of the self hold incompatible goals, values, or beliefs. Unlike external conflicts between individuals, these inner struggles occur within a single psyche, creating psychological tension that demands resolution. This tension often operates as a hidden driver of behavior, influencing decisions in ways that may seem mysterious even to the individual experiencing them.

Several theoretical frameworks help explain these conflicts, each revealing different aspects of the behind-the-scenes psychological dynamics:

**Psychodynamic Perspective**: Freud's structural model described conflict between the id (primitive desires), superego (internalized moral standards), and ego (mediating force balancing desires with reality). While contemporary psychology has moved beyond this specific formulation, the concept of competing psychological forces remains valuable. The hidden conflict between unconscious desires and conscious values creates many of the puzzling contradictions in human behavior.

**Cognitive Dissonance Theory**: Psychologist Leon Festinger identified how holding contradictory beliefs or values creates uncomfortable psychological tension that motivates efforts to reduce inconsistency, often through changing attitudes or rationalizing behaviors. This behind-the-scenes discomfort drives much of human self-justification and belief change, representing a powerful but often unrecognized influence on perception and memory.

**Self-Discrepancy Theory**: E. Tory Higgins's research examines conflicts between different self-representations—the actual self (who we believe we are), ideal self (who we aspire to be), and ought self (who we feel obligated to be). Discrepancies between these self-concepts create specific emotional distress. The hidden conflict between these different self-representations explains why people sometimes feel like impostors in their own lives or experience persistent dissatisfaction despite objective success.

**Motivational Conflict Models**: Contemporary approaches focus on competing motivational systems—approach versus avoidance tendencies, short-term versus long-term goals, and automatic versus controlled processes—that create predictable conflict patterns. These behind-the-scenes motivational conflicts explain why willpower often fails and why good intentions don't reliably translate into consistent behavior.

These frameworks highlight different aspects of internal conflict, but all recognize its central role in human psychology and behavior. The pivotal turning point in psychological development often occurs when individuals develop awareness of these previously unconscious conflicts, allowing for more intentional navigation rather than automatic reaction.

**Common Types of Internal Conflict**

Several patterns of internal conflict appear consistently across individuals and cultures, each creating distinctive behind-the-scenes psychological dynamics:

**Desire vs. Values**: Perhaps the most familiar conflict involves tension between what we want and what we believe is right. This might manifest as temptation to cheat despite valuing honesty, attraction to forbidden relationships despite commitment to fidelity, or consumption desires despite environmental values. The hidden conflict between hedonic desires and moral principles creates much of the guilt, shame, and rationalization that characterizes human experience.

James, a 42-year-old executive, describes this conflict: "I believe strongly in environmental sustainability and judge others for their excessive consumption. Yet I find myself drawn to luxury cars and frequent travel that contradicts these values. I rationalize each purchase but feel guilty afterward, knowing I'm not living according to my stated principles." The behind-the-scenes conflict between his environmental values and status desires creates constant psychological tension that manifests in both behavior and emotional discomfort.

A pivotal turning point occurred when James recognized this pattern: "I realized I was spending enormous energy maintaining an image of environmental concern while making choices that contradicted it. This awareness was uncomfortable but liberating—I could finally acknowledge the competing values rather than pretending they didn't exist." This recognition represents a crucial developmental achievement—moving from unconscious conflict to conscious awareness that allows for more intentional choice.

**Short-term vs. Long-term Interests**: Humans consistently struggle with choices between immediate gratification and longer-term benefits. This conflict appears in health behaviors (momentary pleasure vs. long-term wellbeing), financial decisions (spending vs. saving), and career choices (comfortable stability vs. challenging growth). The hidden conflict between present and future selves explains many of the self-control challenges that characterize human behavior.

The behind-the-scenes nature of this conflict often manifests in what psychologists call "temporal discounting"—the tendency to devalue future outcomes compared to immediate ones. This discounting occurs not through conscious choice but through automatic psychological processes that prioritize immediate rewards. The pivotal turning point in managing this conflict often involves developing what psychologists call "episodic future thinking"—the ability to vividly imagine future experiences in ways that make them emotionally real rather than abstract concepts.

**Autonomy vs. Connection**: Most people simultaneously need both independence and relationship, creating tension when these needs conflict. This appears in relationship decisions (commitment vs. freedom), work-life balance challenges (career advancement vs. family time), and social boundaries (pleasing others vs. self-care). The hidden conflict between these fundamental human needs explains much of the ambivalence that characterizes close relationships.

Sarah, a 35-year-old professional, experienced this conflict intensely: "I deeply value my independence and career achievement, but I also long for partnership and family. Every time a relationship becomes serious, I feel suffocated and pull away; when I'm alone, I feel incomplete and lonely." The behind-the-scenes conflict between autonomy and connection needs created a pattern of approach-avoidance that prevented relationship stability.

A pivotal turning point occurred during therapy when Sarah recognized that she viewed autonomy and connection as mutually exclusive: "I realized I had created a false dichotomy—believing I could either have independence OR relationship, but not both. This insight allowed me to seek partnerships that respected my autonomy rather than assuming all relationships would require surrendering it." This cognitive reframing represents a sophisticated developmental achievement—moving from either/or thinking to both/and integration that accommodates seemingly contradictory needs.

**Multiple Identities**: People often develop different self-concepts across various life domains, creating conflict when these identities hold incompatible values or goals. A person might experience tension between professional identity (requiring assertiveness) and cultural identity (valuing humility), or between parent identity (emphasizing responsibility) and individual identity (desiring self-expression). The hidden conflict between these different self-aspects explains why people sometimes feel fragmented or inauthentic across different life contexts.

Miguel, a 29-year-old first-generation professional, describes this conflict: "In my workplace, success requires self-promotion and direct communication. But in my family and cultural community, these same behaviors are considered disrespectful and arrogant. I feel like I'm betraying some part of myself no matter which standards I follow." The behind-the-scenes conflict between these different identity aspects created persistent psychological distress despite external success.

A pivotal turning point occurred when Miguel developed what psychologists call "bicultural competence"—the ability to navigate different cultural contexts without feeling that either represents the "real self." This achievement represents a sophisticated identity development that moves beyond the either/or conflict to a more complex self-concept that can express different aspects in different contexts without experiencing this as inconsistency or betrayal.

**Fear vs. Growth**: Personal development often requires facing fears and discomfort, creating conflict between safety needs and growth aspirations. This appears in career decisions (secure job vs. risky opportunity), relationship vulnerability (protection from hurt vs. intimacy potential), and skill development (comfort in competence vs. discomfort of learning). The hidden conflict between security and expansion explains much of the ambivalence that characterizes human development opportunities.

The behind-the-scenes nature of this conflict often manifests in what psychologists call "self-handicapping"—creating obstacles to success that provide ready-made explanations for potential failure. This protection strategy operates largely outside awareness, allowing individuals to pursue growth opportunities while simultaneously sabotaging them to avoid the full risk of failure. The pivotal turning point in managing this conflict often involves developing what psychologist Carol Dweck calls a "growth mindset"—the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work rather than being fixed traits.

**Conscious vs. Unconscious Motivations**: Perhaps most challenging are conflicts between conscious intentions and unconscious motivations. Someone might consciously desire relationship commitment while unconsciously fearing intimacy, or explicitly pursue success while unconsciously sabotaging achievements due to unworthiness beliefs. These hidden conflicts between different levels of awareness explain many of the puzzling contradictions in human behavior.

David, a 40-year-old entrepreneur, experienced this conflict: "I consciously wanted business success and worked incredibly hard to achieve it. Yet whenever a major opportunity arose, I'd somehow create problems that undermined it—missing deadlines, alienating partners, or failing to follow through. It was like part of me was deliberately sabotaging what another part wanted most." The behind-the-scenes conflict between his conscious ambition and unconscious fear of success created a pattern of self-defeating behavior that persisted for years.

A pivotal turning point occurred when therapy helped David connect his success fears with childhood experiences: "I realized I unconsciously believed that success would lead to rejection—that people would resent or abandon me if I achieved too much. This belief came from early experiences but was operating completely outside my awareness, driving behaviors that made no sense to my conscious mind." This insight represents a crucial psychological achievement—connecting conscious experience with unconscious motivations that allows for integration rather than continued internal sabotage.

These conflicts aren't merely theoretical—they create measurable effects on decision processes, emotional experiences, and behavioral outcomes. The pivotal turning point in psychological development often involves recognizing these conflicts as internal rather than external—understanding that the battle occurs between different aspects of self rather than between self and world. This recognition creates the possibility for integration rather than endless conflict.

**How Internal Conflicts Influence Decision Making**

Internal conflicts affect decision making through several mechanisms, creating behind-the-scenes influences that shape choices in ways that may seem mysterious or irrational:

**Decision Avoidance**: When facing strong internal conflict, people often postpone decisions entirely, creating what psychologists call "decision paralysis." This avoidance temporarily reduces psychological discomfort but often creates practical problems as opportunities pass or circumstances deteriorate. The hidden conflict between different values or goals creates paralysis not through conscious choice but through automatic protection mechanisms that help avoid the pain of choosing between important aspects of self.

A pivotal turning point in decision capability often occurs when individuals develop what psychologists call "psychological flexibility"—the ability to experience conflicting thoughts and feelings without becoming overwhelmed or immobilized by them. This capacity allows for making difficult choices despite internal conflict rather than waiting for conflict to resolve before acting.

**Preference Instability**: Conflicts between different aspects of self can create shifting preferences depending on which aspect is temporarily dominant. This explains why someone might firmly decide to end an unhealthy relationship when focusing on self-respect, then reverse this decision when loneliness activates attachment needs. The behind-the-scenes conflict between different motivational systems creates what appears to be inconsistency but actually reflects the changing dominance of different aspects of self.

The pivotal turning point in managing preference instability often involves developing what psychologists call "meta-awareness"—the ability to observe one's changing mental states without being completely identified with any particular state. This capacity allows for recognizing when decisions are being driven by temporarily activated needs rather than enduring values.

**Compromise Solutions**: People often resolve internal conflicts through compromise options that partially satisfy competing motives but fully satisfy neither. While sometimes adaptive, these compromises can create mediocre outcomes when "splitting the difference" between incompatible goals. The hidden conflict between different values or goals creates compromise not through conscious strategy but through automatic conflict-reduction mechanisms that seek to minimize psychological discomfort.

A pivotal turning point in decision quality often occurs when individuals develop what psychologists call "integrative complexity"—the ability to find solutions that address underlying needs rather than superficial positions. This capacity allows for creative problem-solving that satisfies seemingly incompatible goals rather than settling for unsatisfying compromises.

**Context-Dependent Choices**: Internal conflicts often lead to inconsistent decisions across situations as different contexts activate different aspects of the self. Someone might make health-conscious food choices when dining alone but abandon these intentions in social settings where belonging needs become more salient. The
